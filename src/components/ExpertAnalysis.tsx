Response from Cognito-RESEARCH:

Immediate Strategy: Foundational Research Plan

Phase 1: Qualitative Exploration. I will immediately design and recruit for a series of 15 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with a mix of potential users (e.g., college students, young professionals, parents). The goal is to deeply understand their financial anxieties, current habits, and "jobs-to-be-done" related to managing money.
